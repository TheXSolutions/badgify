# Random Colors

For generating random colors you can use the following api with a random param as `bg` or `color` :

`badgify.thex.solutions/api/badge/title?title=random&bg=random`

**We strongly recommend you to do not use random colors for badge's text color! Because the random color produced can not match the background color in contrast and make it difficult to see your text in the badge.**
